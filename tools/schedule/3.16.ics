DESCRIPTION:No string changes may be made without confirmation from the i1
 8n team and notification to release team\, translation team\, and document
 ation team.\nFrom this point\, developers can concentrate on stability and
  bug-fixing. Translators can work without worrying that the original Engli
 sh strings will change\, and documentation writers can take accurate scree
 nshots.\nFor the string freezes explained\, and to see which kind of chang
 es are not covered by freeze rules\, check https://wiki.gnome.org/Translat
 ionProject/HandlingStringFreezes.
