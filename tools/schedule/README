To set the schedule for a new version of GNOME, after creating a new .schedule file:

* Bump version number for DEFAULT_SCHEDULE in releng/tools/schedule/libschedule.py
* Run releng/tools/schedule/ical.py > 3.x.ics to create ICAL file
* git add/commit/push that ics file into releng/tools/schedule/
* Run releng/tools/schedule/wiki.py to create copy&paste schedule to paste into wikipage
* Copy skeleton from e.g. https://wiki.gnome.org/Forty to e.g. https://wiki.gnome.org/FortyOne, update numbers, add the schedule
* Copy ics file to Infrastructure/static-web/calendars and git commit/push it. Example: https://gitlab.gnome.org/Infrastructure/static-web/-/commit/a887c9e44b36dfa6c96db093356f3222bef7d977
