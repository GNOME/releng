  bug-fixing. Translators can work without worrying that the original Engli
 sh strings will change\, and documentation writers can take accurate scree
 nshots.\nFor the string freezes explained\, and to see which kind of chang
 es are not covered by freeze rules\, check http://live.gnome.org/Translati
