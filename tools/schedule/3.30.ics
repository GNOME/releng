DESCRIPTION:No string changes may be made without confirmation from the i18
 n team and notification to release team\, translation team\, and documenta
 tion team.\nFrom this point\, developers can concentrate on stability and 
 bug-fixing. Translators can work without worrying that the original Englis
 h strings will change\, and documentation writers can take accurate screen
 shots.\nFor the string freezes explained\, and to see which kind of change
 s are not covered by freeze rules\, check https://wiki.gnome.org/Translati
