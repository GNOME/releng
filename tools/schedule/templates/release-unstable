Hi,

Tarballs are due on Monday October 29th before 23:59 UTC for the GNOME
2.21.1 Development Release, which will be delivered on Wednesday.
Modules which were proposed for inclusion should try to follow the 2.21
schedule so everyone can test them.

Also note that Monday October 29th at 23:59 UTC also marks the deadline
for new (app) modules proposal. For directions on proposing your module,
please see:
   http://live.gnome.org/ReleasePlanning/ModuleProposing

Please make sure that your tarballs will be uploaded before Monday 23:59
UTC: tarballs uploaded later than that will probably be too late to get
in 2.21.1. If you are not able to make a tarball before this deadline or
if you think you'll be late, please send a mail to the release team and
we'll find someone to roll the tarball for you!

For more informations about 2.21, the full schedule, the official
module lists and the proposed module lists, please see our colorful 2.21
