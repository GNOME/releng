 ct fields.\n\nThis provides a stable development platform for the rest of 
 the schedule.\n\nThere should usually be a "Slushy" API/ABI Freeze before 
 the Hard API/ABI Freeze\, to encourage developers to think about API probl
 ems while they have a chance to correct them.\n\nAPI freeze is not require

DESCRIPTION:Desktop and platform release module additions are finalised\, 
 major feature additions are listed. No new modules or features will be acc
 epted for this release period. "Feature" should be interpreted as "Functio
 nality" or "Ability". Bug fixes of existing features are not affected.\n\n
 This allows developers to concentrate on refining the new features instead
  of adding yet more functionality.
