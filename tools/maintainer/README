These scripts are here to help maintainers release and announce
package releases.

maintainer.py:
==============
Used by maintainers to do some of the laborious tasks when releasing
an application, like retrieving a list of fixes from Bugzilla,
creating a release note, etc.

announcer.py:
=============
Used to produce an email template based on the debian/changelog so
that you can literally just press 'send' in your email application.
