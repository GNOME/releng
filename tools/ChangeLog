	Avoid unstable vte releases, fix download locations for gstreamer
	tarballs

2006-05-17  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	* smoketesting/tarball-conversion.config:
	Let's make this the last time I fall for that gstreamer mess.
	This change will need to be undone if gstreamer and gst-plugins-*
	become external dependencies, though.

2006-05-17  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	* release_set_scripts/release-suites:
	Ugh, let's hope this kills those permission problems

	* smoketesting/convert-to-tarballs.py:
	Handle adding subdir names (e.g. c++, python) to the versions file
	where needed.  Still don't have items sorted by module, though.

	* smoketesting/tarball-conversion.config:
	Remove pkg-config since we haven't been including it for a while
	anyway and updates aren't being placed on ftp.gnome.org anymore,
	add subdirectory specifications for bindings modules so that they
	appear in the versions file

	* versions-stable:
	* smoketesting/sample-tarball-stable.jhbuildrc:

	* release_set_scripts/release-suites:
	Remove the ugly permissions warnings (and actually fix up

	don't miss the other warnings.  Also, add a note about adding a
	new release set.

2006-01-30  Elijah Newren  <newren gmail com>

	* smoketesting/tarball-conversion.config:
	Update to include new modules, though I was uncertain how/if we'd
	handle gnome-power-manager, libnotify, and notification-daemon.

	* smoketesting/tarball-conversion-2-12.config:
	Add gnome-2.12 versions of these files to make the 2.12 releases
	easier (okay, so there'll only be one more but they'll still be
	useful at that time plus they might be helpful for others to look
	at when it comes time for the 2.14/2.15 simultaneous development
	too)

2005-11-16  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* versions: updated
	* smoketesting/tarball-conversion.config: typo

2005-10-26  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* versions: updated
	* smoketesting/sample-tarball.jhbuildrc: add comment about the
	--disable-mozilla switch for totem
	* smoketesting/tarball-conversion.config: no more limit for ORBit2

2005-10-05  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	* release_set_scripts/release-suites: Add a little comment about
	what to do if you want to re-run release-suites (because, e.g. you
	had an out-of-date version number for a tarball in your versions
	file)

2005-10-05  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	* versions: update again for 2.12.1 to include the samba
	compilation fix in gnome-vfs-2.12.1.1

	* release_set_scripts/release-diff: tml's win32 stuff in the
	release directories breaks stuff unless you're very careful about
	how to call this function--document it.

	* simple-diff:
	* simple-news:
	New scripts that call release-diff and release-news, respectively,
	but which don't require such freaking long argument lines and that
	loop over all the release suites for you.

2005-10-04  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	* versions: update for 2.12.1

	* smoketesting/sample-tarball.jhbuildrc: update for
	2.12.1--account for jhbuild not automatically including
	/usr/lib/pkgconfig in PKG_CONFIG_PATH

2005-10-04  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	* smoketesting/convert-to-tarballs.py:
	allow the whilelist to provide version number limits

	* smoketesting/tarball-conversion.config:
	set limit on ORBit2 to 2.13 and on gstreamer to 0.9

2005-10-03  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	* smoketesting/convert-to-tarballs.py:
	Strip out checkoutdir attributes on modules; jhbuild doesn't like
	it when tarballs extract to libxml2-2.6.22 and there's a
	checkoutdir attribute claiming it will be named libxml2

	* smoketesting/tarball-conversion.config:
	Remove libpixman, note the new tarball location for cairo
	tarballs, list the tarball location for iso-codes (needed since
	gnome-2.12.modules switched to using cvs for that module), provide
	renames for cairo-1-0 and popler-0-4 to cairo and poppler,
	respectively

2005-09-06  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: 
	I'd rather track changes under tools/ here rather than under the
	main ChangeLog (besides, it looks like we haven't been logging the
	changes so far, so this won't be much different...)

	* smoketesting/covert-to-tarballs.py:
	Handle svnmodule packages

	* versions:
	Update to the versions used in the 2.12.0 release

	* smoketesting/sample-tarball.jhbuildrc:
	Update to 2.12.0 (and skip evolution-exchange since I can't test
	it and most probably can't either)
