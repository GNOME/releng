	* ChangeLog: 
	I'd rather track changes under tools/ here rather than under the
	main ChangeLog (besides, it looks like we haven't been logging the
	changes so far, so this won't be much different...)

	* smoketesting/covert-to-tarballs.py:
	Handle svnmodule packages

	* versions:
	Update to the versions used in the 2.12.0 release

	* smoketesting/sample-tarball.jhbuildrc:
	Update to 2.12.0 (and skip evolution-exchange since I can't test
	it and most probably can't either)
