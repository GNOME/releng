  <title>Vector Graphics</title>

  <para>GNOME &version; has improved support for vector graphics, also known as SVG. Unlike normal graphics, vector graphics can be resized
  with no loss of quality. In particular, this affects the Themes and games.</para>

  <para>Several GNOME games now use vector graphics. You will really notice this when maximising the windows.

  <para>GNOME &version; also has improved support for vector themes. Some vector themes are available separately from
  GNOME &version;, and you can expect to see full vector themes in GNOME 2.8.</para>
