    <title>GNOME &version; Release Notes</title>
    <abstract>
      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>The GNOME &version; Desktop is the latest
	release of the ever popular, multi-platform free desktop environment.</para>
      <para>GNOME &version; has several interesting new features that make day-to-day desktop usage much easier. GNOME &version; also includes many bug fixes, which noticeable improve the user interface, general stability and speed, and the built-in help system.</para>

    <para>GNOME runs on a variety of platforms, including GNU/Linux
    (commonly called Linux), Solaris, HP-UX, BSD and Apple's
    Darwin. GNOME includes powerful features such as world-class
    smooth text rendering, a first-class accessibility infrastructure,
    and a complete internationalization infrastructure that includes
    support for bi-directional text.</para>
    
    <para>GNOME provides a user-friendly environment that &quot;just works&quot;
    for everyday users, without excess complexity or obscure features. At the same
    time we provide the rich flexibility experienced developers
    demand.</para>

    <para>Of course GNOME &version; includes all of the improvements made in
    GNOME &oldversion;, which you can learn about in the GNOME &oldversion; <ulink
    url="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.4/notes/">release notes</ulink>.</para>

    <para>The Desktop release contains all the applications needed
	to provide basic user functionality. Major applications
	such as <application>Gnumeric</application> and
	<application>Evolution</application> are also available, but are
	developed in parallel on their own release cycle rather than
	being included in the core GNOME release.</para>

    <para>GNOME is part of the GNU Project, and is <ulink
    url="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free
    software</ulink>.</para>

    <title>Known Issues</title>
    <para>All software, when it is released, contains bugs the developers know
    about but have elected, for a variety of reasons, not to fix before
    releasing. Free software is no different in this regard from proprietary
    software, except that with free software, we tell users about them.</para>

    <para>We also encourage our users to report bugs so that they can be
    fixed. The best way to report bugs found in GNOME is to use the <ulink
    url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/simple-bug-guide.cgi">Simple Bug
    Guide</ulink>. This will take you through the necessary steps to file a
    quality bug report, and make sure that it is tagged appropriately. If you're
    too advanced for anything with the word 'simple' in it, there is also the
    <ulink url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi">traditional bug
    form</ulink>.

		More details on bugs already reported can be found at our <ulink
		  url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">Bugzilla</ulink>. Among the
		most prominent GNOME &version; bugs:</para>

	 <title>Looking to GNOME 2.6 and Beyond</title> 
	      
	      <para>GNOME operates on a time-based release philosophy, an
		attempt to continuously provide the best of our developers' efforts
		to users as quickly as we can. Six months after GNOME &version;,
		we anticipate that GNOME &nextversion; will feature TODO and further advances in
		accessibility, usability and internationalization.</para>
