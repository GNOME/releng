    <para>
    Nautilus, the GNOME file manager, has several significant improvements in GNOME &version;. These

    handling file (MIME) types shared with freedesktop.org and KDE.
    </para>

    <para>
    This new file type system allows users to select an application out of a list of applications
    available to handle the particular file.
