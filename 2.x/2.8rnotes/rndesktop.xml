    <para>
    The GNOME file manager now uses an improved and standardized file-type system. This allows applications to tell GNOME that they can open certain types of file. The same system will soon be used by other desktops such as KDE, so this will allow different desktops and applications to work together more smoothly. Because this is a new system, applications must update how they register their file types. This should happen automatically when Linux distributions provide an upgrade to GNOME &version;.</para>
    <para>
    For each file-type there is a default application that will open the file when you double-click on the it. However, other applications might also be able to open the file type, so you can right-click and choose &quot;Open With&quot; to select one of these applications.

     <para>In the rare case that an application has not registered itself properly, or when you wish to use a different application to open a certain file type, you can add it manually. You can also use the properties page to select your default
     application for files of that type.</para>

   Finally, GNOME Volume Manager, a next generation volume managemant tool that
   utilizes the new Hardware Abstraction Layer, is available to automatically
   mount CDs, play music CDs, play DVDs (with appropriate player, such as Totem,
   installed), and browse digital camera (with appropriate software, such as
   F-Stop installed).

    Appointments and tasks are easier to manage now they are integrated into
    the GNOME clock on your panel. Support for multiple backends now allow you
    to keep your appointments in check. Have separate calendars for your
    personal and work appointments, as well as your appointment book from
    Exchange and online calendars available over the internet.
