  we work on GNOME.

    GNOME is one of the few open source projects to take a stand for end
          user usability over geeky hyper-configurability.
    Our <ulink

          Guidelines</ulink>, developed by a team of UI professionals, are the
          most complete guidelines yet from the open source community.

      <title>Accessibility.</title>
      
        <para>
          Many governments, including the US government, require comprehensive
          accessibility support in software they purchase.  After dozens of
          person-years of effort, GNOME is the only free software desktop to
          address this issue (with nice side effects for all users, such as full
          keyboard navigation).

      <title>Performance.</title>
      
        <para>
          GNOME 2.0 and 2.2 are smaller and faster than previous versions 
          of GNOME, a welcome trend.
