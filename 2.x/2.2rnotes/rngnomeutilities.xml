    <para>The Character Map now has unicode support allowing you to select a
full range of characters in a wide range of fonts. Users may be interested in
the Unicode Character Map [gucharmap] that should be released in the Fifth Toe,
later this year.</para>

    <para>The Search for Files dialog has undergone several changes that add to
the overall usability and feel of the utility. It now allows you to drag and
drop files from the search results pane. With the addition of adding icon theme
and handling the file manager MIME types, this utility is very much more
integrated with the desktop.</para>

    <para>We have brought back 'gdialog', the Gtk/GNOME version of the dialog
utility. This utility is useful for using with scripts, in particular Nautilus
scripts. Users may be interested in Zenity, a basic rewrite of 'gdialog', that
should be released in the Fifth Toe, later this year.</para>
