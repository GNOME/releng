    <title>Panel</title>
    <para>The panel can now be themed along with the rest of the desktop, including icon theming. And like the rest of GNOME 2.2, it supports multi-head systems.</para>

    <para>Here are a few of the more significant GNOME panel improvements:</para>

    <sect3><title>Show Desktop</title>
    <para>
    When the icons on your desktop are hidden by too many open windows, you can now quickly hide them and then bring them all back again by clicking the "Show Desktop" button in the panel.
    </para>

    <sect3><title>Run Program</title>
    <para>
    To launch an application that is not already in your panel's menu you can now select, or type, its name in the "Run Program" dialog box. This is much simpler than opening a terminal window, typing the name and closing thee terminal.
