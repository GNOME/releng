    <title>Panel</title>
    <para>The panel can now be themed along with the rest of the desktop, including icon theming.</para>

    <para>Here are a few of the more significant GNOME panel improvements:</para>

    <sect2><title>Show Desktop</title>
    <para>
    When the icons on your desktop are hidden by too many open windows, you can now quickly hide them and then bring them all back again by clicking the "Show Desktop" button in the panel.
    </para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2><title>Search For Files</title>
    <para>As before, you can now quickly find files via the Actions menu. Now it has an improved user interface and better integration with the file manager, so you can drag and drop files from the results window. And, like the file manager, it can open files with the appropriate applications.
    </para>
