    <para>GNOME's X backend now supports simultaneous
 connections to multiple X servers and X servers with
 multiple screens, via GTK+ 2.2. Toplevel windows can be migrated between 
 screens, and even servers, on the fly. GTK+ also now
 includes support for systems that merge multiple monitors 
 into a single large virtual area, such as Xinerama.</para>
