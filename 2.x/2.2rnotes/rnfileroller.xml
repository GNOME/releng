    <para>File Roller is an archive manager that allows you to view, extract
      and create archive files. File Roller supports a wide range of 
      archive formats and, like the Search for Files dialog, is closely integrated
      into the GNOME desktop, with support for icon themes, drag and drop
      support and MIME type handling.</para>
