  <title>Platform Improvements</title>

  number of improvements to the underlying platform that should be
  appreciated by developers building applications on top of GNOME's powerful
  framework.</para>

    <title>GConf</title>
  <para>The GConf daemon now maintains its locks in /tmp by default which
    means GConf will not attempt to contact a daemon on a remote
    machine if the user is using a shared NFS home directory. To use
    the old behaviour of maintaining the lock in ~/.gconfd, you can
    set the GCONF_GLOBAL_LOCKS environment variable.</para>
  <para>gconf_entry_copy(), gconf_entry_ref() and gconf_entry_unref()
    added for memory management of GConfEntry. gconf_entry_free() is
    deprecated.</para>
    <para>A number of options have been added to gconftool:
