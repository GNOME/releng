    Epiphany uses the simplest interface possible for a
    browser. Simple does not necessarily mean less powerful. Its
    design is based on the belief that commonly used browsers of today
    are too big, buggy, and bloated. Epiphany achieves simplicity by
    focusing on web browsing, and by tightly integrating with other
    parts of the GNOME platform, instead of reproducing that
    functionality in the browser.

    Epiphany also works to ensure freedom of choice by being standards
    compliant. Respecting web standards, so that users can see the
    same content regardless of their choice of browser or platform, is
    an important step towards guaranteeing freedom of choice. Epiphany
    and GNOME seek to ensure choice by using Gecko, the most
    standards-compliant rendering engine available.</para>
