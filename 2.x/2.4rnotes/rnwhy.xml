    <title>So, why GNOME?</title>

   
    <para>
  Having seen some of the new features in GNOME &version;, why choose GNOME
  over other desktop environments? Every GNOME volunteer has their own
  motivations, of course, but here are some of the common reasons many
  of us choose to work on GNOME.

      <title>Usability</title>
      <para>
        GNOME is one of the few open source projects to take a stand
    for ease of use and UI consistency over geeky
    hyper-configurability.  Our <ulink
    url="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/"> Human
    Interface Guidelines</ulink>, developed by a team of UI
    professionals and GNOME volunteers, and released before GNOME &version;,
    are the most complete Free Software usability guidelines yet. We
    believe that this focus on usability will produce a user
    environment that "just works" and as a result lets GNOME users-
    both experienced and inexperienced- focus on the task at hand
    instead of on their applications.

    <title>Accessibility</title>
      
    <para>
      Beyond making GNOME easier to use for the average computer user, GNOME has
          also taken the lead in making the unix desktop accessible to those
          with disabilities. GNOME's accessibility technologies allow (for
          example) the use of braille readers, voice synthesizers, and pointing
          devices. This has nice side effects for other users, as well- for
          example, all of GNOME should now be keyboard navigable, and many GNOME
          interfaces have more informative tooltips. Many governments, including
          the US government, require comprehensive accessibility support in
          software they purchase. After dozens of person-years of effort, GNOME
          is the only free software desktop to address this issue.

      <title>Improved performance</title>
      
        <para>
          GNOME 2.0 and later are smaller and faster than previous versions of
          GNOME, bucking the common trend in computer software in which the
          latest versions require ever more resources. The file manager in
          particular continues to improve, as it now uses faster techniques for
          rendering and icon creation.

       <title>Interface Stability</title>
       <para>
       The key libraries in the GNOME Development Platform carry
       guarantees of API and ABI stability. This means that 'porting'
       an application from GNOME 2.0 to GNOME &version; 
       should involve exactly nothing, if a developer does not wish to
       take advantage of new functionality in the libraries.

      <title>Mature applications</title>
      
        <para>
          Popular and robust applications such as Mozilla, Galeon,
          Evolution, Gnumeric, Abiword, GAIM, X-Chat, and more are
          based on GNOME or GTK+. These applications are among the
          most powerful and capable in the Free Software world, and we
          expect that they'll only get better as they take more
          advantage of the GNOME development environment.

          All GNOME platform libraries are licensed under the <ulink
          url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">LGPL</ulink> or similar
          license, so developing for the GNOME platform is 100% free of license
          fees, both for developers of Free and proprietary software.

          Active contributors to GNOME &version; development include Red Hat,
