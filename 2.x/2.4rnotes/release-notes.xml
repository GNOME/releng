    <title>DRAFT GNOME &version; Release Notes</title>
    <abstract>
      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>The GNOME &version; Desktop is the latest
	release of the popular, multi-platform free desktop environment.</para>
      <para>GNOME &version; expands the offerings of the popular free software
	desktop, with a new web browser based on the most
	standards-compliant
	rendering engine available, improved accessibility tools, a number of
      new applications to make day-to-day desktop use easier and a continued
      commitment to creating a computing environment that "just works".</para>

<!-- http://makeashorterlink.com/?S27F22875 bugzilla query to check fulfilled
      enhancement requests since 2.2 courtesy aldug -->

      <para>GNOME &version; includes 11 new applications and more than 100
      user-requested enhancements, evidence of the user-driven community
      development process used to create each GNOME release.</para>

    <para>GNOME runs on a variety of platforms, including GNU/Linux
    (commonly called Linux), Solaris, HP-UX, BSD and Apple's
    Darwin. GNOME includes powerful features such as world-class
    smooth text rendering, a first-class accessibility infrastructure,
    and a complete internationalization infrastructure that includes
    support for bi-directional text.</para>
    
    <para>GNOME provides a user-friendly environment that "just works"
    for everyday users, without excess complexity, while at the same
    time providing the rich flexibility experienced developers
    demand. We have tried to avoid unnecessary complications or
    obscure features, sticking instead to a clear, unified
    vision of a usable, powerful desktop.</para>

    <para>Of course GNOME &version; includes all of the improvements made in
    GNOME &oldversion;, which you can learn about in the GNOME &oldversion; <ulink
    url="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.2/notes/">release notes</ulink>.</para>

    <para>The Desktop release contains all the applications needed
	to provide basic user functionality. Major applications
	such as <application>Gnumeric</application> and
	<application>Evolution</application> also are available, but are
	developed in parallel on their own release cycle rather than
	being included in the core GNOME release.</para>

    <para>GNOME is part of the GNU Project, and is <ulink
    url="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free
    software</ulink>.</para>

    <title>Known Issues</title>
    <para>All software, when it is released, contains bugs the developers know
    about but have elected, for a variety of reasons, not to fix before
    releasing. Free software is no different in this regard from proprietary
    software, except that with free software, we tell users about them.</para>

    <para>We also encourage our users to report bugs so that they can be
    fixed. The best way to report bugs found in GNOME is to use the <ulink
    url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/simple-bug-guide.cgi">Simple Bug
    Guide</ulink>. This will take you through the necessary steps to file a
    quality bug report, and make sure that it is tagged appropriately. If you're
    too advanced for anything with the word 'simple' in it, there is also the
    <ulink url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi">traditional bug
    form</ulink>.

		More details on bugs already reported can be found at our <ulink
		  url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">Bugzilla</ulink>. Among the
		most prominent GNOME &version; bugs:</para>

	 <title>Looking to GNOME 2.6 and Beyond</title> 
	      

	      <para>GNOME operates on a time-based release philosophy, an
		attempt to continuously provide the best of our hackers' efforts
		to users as quickly as we can. Six months after GNOME &version;,
		we anticipate that GNOME 2.6 will feature the next release of
		GTK+, introducing new file selector and "combo" widgets,
		powerful menu and toolbar widgets and further advances in
		accessibility, usability and internationalization.</para>
