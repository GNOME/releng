    <para>
  Due to GNOME's strict string freeze policy leading up to the release,
  the <ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gtp/">GNOME Translation Project</ulink> was able to translate 100 percent of strings for 14 languages by release time, and 
  nearly 100 percent for 12 more.  The string freeze will continue on the 
  2.2 branch, so more and more translations will be completed in the coming weeks.

  In this release, GTK+ 2.2 has improved support for right-to-left 
  languages, and support for OpenType Indic fonts, adding to the excellent 
  internationalization support already available in GTK+ 2.0.
