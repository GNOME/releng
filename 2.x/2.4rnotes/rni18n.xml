    Due to GNOME's strict string freeze policy leading up to the release,
    the <ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gtp/">GNOME Translation
    Project</ulink> was able to translate 100 percent of strings for ???
    languages by release time, and  nearly 100 percent for ??? more.  The string
    freeze will continue on the &version; branch, so more and more translations will
    be completed in upcoming point releases.</para>
