  <title>Gcalctool</title>
  <para>Thanks to the efforts of Rich Burridge, GNOME &version; includes
  <application>Gcalctool</application>, a new
    version of the venerable <application>Calctool</application> calculator
    originally released to comp.sources.unix in the late
    1980's. <application>Gcalctool</application> replaces the <application>GNOME
      Calculator</application>, which used to be included in the
  <application>gnome-utils</application> package.</para>

  <para>Gcalctool has Basic, Financial and Scientific modes. Calculations are
 	    performed from left to right, with no arithmetic precedence. If you
 	    need arithmetic precedence, then you should use parentheses. Basic
 	    Mode provides standard calculator functions. You can store numbers
 	    in 10 different memory registers, and easily retrieve and replace
 	    the numbers in the memory registers. Basic Mode is the default
 	    mode. You can use all of the Basic Mode functions in each of the
 	    other modes. Financial Mode provides several complex financial
 	    functions. Scientific Mode provides many additional mathematical
 	    functions, including trigonometric and logical functions. You can
 	    also store your own functions and constants, when you use Scientific
 	    Mode.</para>
