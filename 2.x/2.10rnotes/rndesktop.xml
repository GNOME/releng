    <para>
     The file manager, also known as Nautilus, is even faster and more stable in 
     GNOME &version;, thanks to changes to its internal architecture. This should 
     allow software developers to extend the file manager more easily in future.
    </para>
    <para>
     The file manager now also works more smoothly with other applications, such as
     Mozilla and Firefox, and has more navigation options. TODO: What options, exactly?
