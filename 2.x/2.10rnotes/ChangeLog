	* rndesktop.xml: Mention metacity focus-stealing prevention.
	* rnapplets.xml: Mention new Places and Desktop menus, replacing 
	Actions, and mention freedesktop menu spec.
	* rninstallation.xml: Remove the build order, because it is never 
	quite correct, and its far from enough information to build it, and 
	even if it was people would still have unique problems. Pointed 
	people to garnome and jhbuild instead. The LiveCD gets first mention, 
	of course.
