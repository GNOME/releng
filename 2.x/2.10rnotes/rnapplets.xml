<sect2 id="rnapplets">
  <title>Panel Items</title>

  <para>
   GNOME &version; includes major improvements to its panel items (also known as applets), providing new features, and better integration with the rest of the desktop.
  </para>

  <para>
   Most applets can now be partly transparent, when the panel itself is transparent.
  </para>
 
  <sect3 id="rnapplets-modemlights">
  <title>Integrated Modem Control</title>
  <para>
   GNOME &version; introduces a new applet for controlling your Modem, integrated with GNOME System Tools.

  <sect3 id="rnapplets-trash">
  <title>Panel Trashcan</title>

  <para>
   GNOME &version; features an optional trashcan for your Panel.
   Just like the trashcan on your desktop, you can now drag and drop files and other items into the trash
   without minimising your open windows.

  <sect3 id="rnapplets-drivemount">
  <title>Control Mounted Volumes</title>

  <para>
   GNOME 2.8 allowed you to easily mount your digital media, such as CDs, DVDs, and USB memory sticks.
   Now the volume mounter applet helps you to use these volumes without the difficulty of finding their icons on the desktop, behind 
   your open windows. The applet shows the currently mounted (or unmountable) volumes, allowing 
   you to mount them, eject them, or open them in the file manager.

  <sect3 id="rnapplets-gweather">
  <title>Get even more weather</title>
  <para>
   The weather monitor can now show even more locations then before, and the 
   location names have been translated into non-english languages where appropriate.
   In addition, the forecast now includes sunrise and sunset calculations for most locations.

  <sect3 id="rnapplets-mixer">
  <title>Sound control</title>
  <para>
   A new mixer for your panel (combined with a new look mixer on the desktop)
   gets the most from your sound hardware. Using the GStreamer
   multimedia framework, the mixer is now more convenient and stable then before. 
   The same multimedia framework powers Totem, Sound Juicer, the GNOME CD player 
   and a variety of third-party applications, so changing the GNOME volume 
   via the panel will change the volume of all these applications. TODO: Is this last sentence true/new/meaningful?
  </para>
  </sect3>

  <sect3 id="rnapplets-stickynotes">
  <title>Taking note</title>
  <para>
   The popular Sticky Notes applet has a simpler user interface and many bugs have been fixed, so it's 
   now even easier to add PostIt-style notes on your desktop. For instance, sticky notes will now stay 
   on the correct workspace, or even a different monitor.
  </para>
  <para>And sticky motes now stay on top other windows, so you can't lose them. To hide the notes,
   simply use the applet's right-click menu. 
  </para>
  </sect3>

  <sect3 id="rnapplet-cpufreq">
  <title>Specially for laptops</title>
  <para>
   GNOME now includes an applet to monitor your laptop's processor speed. The CPU
   Frequency Monitor talks to variable-speed processers (such as those with 
   Intel Speedstep) to show their current status. It even allows you to choose 
   a different speed if you don't have automatic frequency scaling enabled.
  </para>
  </sect3>

 
  <para>
TODO: Rewrite this:
   Some applets have been removed in GNOME &version; because they have either been
   replaced by something better, or were unmainted and insecure. The three
   applets to be removed are, the CD Player applet, the standalone wireless
   monitor and mailbox check applet.

  </para>
  <para>
   The CD Player panel applet did not interoperate well with GNOME CD Player,
   instead now inserting a CD will start GNOME CD Player automatically, it can
   then be controlled from the user interface or from a notification icon that
   is placed in your Panel.
  </para>
  <para>
   The standalone wireless applet has now been superseeded by GNOME Netstatus,
   which has had wireless support since GNOME 2.8.
  </para>
  <para>
   The mailbox monitor has been removed because it was unmaintained and
   insecure. We hope to have an solution integrated with Evolution in the
   future. If you don't use Evolution for your mail, you can use a third party
   application such as <link
   href="http://www.nongnu.org/mailnotify/">mailnotify</link>.
